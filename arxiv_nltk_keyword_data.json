Dobrescu\nAbstract: Scalar particles that couple to two up quarks may be produced at the LHC even\nif they are ultraheavy, in the $8-10$ TeV mass range. A renormalizable theory\nthat includes a diquark particle of this type ($S_{uu}$), two vectorlike quarks\n($\\chi_1, \\chi_2$), and a gauge-singlet pseudoscalar, predicts LHC signals\ninvolving four or more jets of very high $p_T$. Two remarkable events observed\nby the CMS experiment, each involving four high $p_T$-jets, may be due to an\n$S_{uu}$ of mass near 8.5 TeV, and a $\\chi_2$ mass of 2.1 TeV. A separate\nexcess reported by CMS in the nonresonant dijet pair search is consistent with\na $\\chi_1$ mass of $0.95$ TeV. This hypothesis may be tested through CMS and\nATLAS searches for signals with a pair of dijet resonances of masses clustered\naround 1 TeV, and separately around 2 TeV, which have $4j$ invariant masses in\nthe $5-8$ TeV range. These additional signals would arise from cascade decays\nof $S_{uu} \\to \\chi_2 \\chi_2 $, which lead to $5j$ and $6j$ events with\ninvariant masses around 8 TeV. Depending on the couplings of the heavy colored\nparticles, additional signals are possible, involving for example\nhighly-boosted top quarks."

Our\ngoal is to provide viable quark-matter equation of state (EoS) that can\ngenerally be used for hybrid-star constructions. To that end, we mainly focus\non quark-star properties in this work. By varying the vector and diquark\ncoupling constants, we analyze their impact on the EoS, speed of sound (SoS),\nthe maximum diquark gap, and the mass-radius relation. In almost all\nconfigurations, a stable color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase appears in the core of\nthe maximum-mass configurations, typically spanning several kms in radius. In\nother cases, the star's two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) branch of the\nEoS becomes unstable before reaching the CFL transition density. At\nneutron-star densities, the SoS squared reaches up to 0.6 and the CFL diquark\ngap up to 250 MeV. We argue that adding a hadronic EoS at lower densities by\nperforming a Maxwell construction, does not increase the maximum mass\nsubstantially, thus we use the 2 solar mass constraint to constrain the NJL\nmodel parameters that are suited for the construction of hybrid-star EoS. We\nconstruct three examples of the hybrid star model, demonstrating that there is\nroom for different CSC compositions. The hybrid EoS obtained in this way can\nhave no 2SC matter or different ratios of 2SC and CFL quark matter in the core.\nWe show that early hadron-quark transitions are possible that can modify the\ntidal deformability at 1.4 solar mass. We will provide tabulated EoS of the\nRG-consistent NJL model for these three parameter sets. We find that these EoS\nare consistent with the imposed constraints from astrophysics and perturbative\nQCD.

We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\\chi$ is\nequivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the\nfixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the\n$\\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct\nfrom those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon\ndefines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant\ncoupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When\nincreasing $\\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length\n$\\xi(\\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice\nscale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the\nvalidity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the\nself-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed\npoint, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT.

Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly\nlimited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of\nthe E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations\nfrom the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of\nupcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address\nlarge-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck.\nTo this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power\nspectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification\nin the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM\nprescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements\nfrom LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial\nand late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these\nscales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are\ndetermined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future\nexperiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical\nfluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose\nmore stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models\npredict at smaller scales (l>100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a\nrecently proposed \"Dark Dimension\" scenario, featuring power amplification at\nlarge scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the\nstandard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that\nfuture CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale\nanomalies that are present in the current CMB data."

In this paper, we propose a minimal extension\nthat introduces a dark sector with a singlet Majorana fermion (as the DM\ncandidate) and a complex scalar singlet. The heavy right-handed neutrinos serve\nmultiple roles: i) explaining the small masses of active neutrinos via the\nseesaw mechanism, ii) generating the BAU through leptogenesis, and iii)\nproducing the cold DM density through their decays.

Iliesiu, Geoff Penington, Mykhaylo Usatyuk\nAbstract: Charged particle emission from black holes with sufficiently large charge is\nexponentially suppressed. As a result, such black holes are driven towards\nextremality by the emission of neutral Hawking radiation. Eventually, an\nisolated black hole gets close enough to extremality that the gravitational\nbackreaction of a single Hawking photon becomes important, and the QFT in\ncurved spacetime approximation breaks down. To proceed further, we need to use\na quantum theory of gravity. We make use of recent progress in our\nunderstanding of the quantum-gravitational thermodynamics of near-extremal\nblack holes to compute the corrected spectrum for both neutral and charged\nHawking radiation, including the effects of backreaction, greybody factors, and\nmetric fluctuations. At low temperatures, large fluctuations in a set of light\nmodes of the metric lead to drastic modifications to neutral particle emission\nthat -- in contrast to the semiclassical prediction -- ensure the black hole\nremains subextremal. Relatedly, angular momentum constraints mean that, close\nenough to extremality, black holes with zero angular momentum no longer emit\nindividual photons and gravitons; the dominant radiation channel consists of\nentangled pairs of photons in angular-momentum singlet states. We also compute\nthe effects of backreaction and metric fluctuations on the emission of charged\nparticles. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the semiclassical Schwinger\nemission rate is essentially unchanged despite the fact that the emission\nprocess leads to large changes in the geometry and thermodynamics of the\nthroat. We present, for the first time, the full history of the evaporation of\na large charged black hole.

For instance,\nacross the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical\nLLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical)\ntie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in\nthe remaining 38.2% of cases.

When the CTMC\nis in a particular state, the associated graph topology of the gossiping\nnetwork is in the way indicated by that state. We evaluate the impact of\ntime-varying graph topologies on the freshness of information for nodes in the\nnetwork. We use the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness\nof information at the nodes. Using a method similar to the first passage\npercolation method, we show that, if one of the states of the CTMC is the fully\nconnected graph and the transition rates of the CTMC are constant, then the\nversion age of a typical node in the network scales logarithmically with the\nnumber of nodes, as in the case if the network was always fully connected.

In this\nwork, we study the construction of learned finite blocklength codes for\nbroadcast channels with feedback.

The existing annotated\ndatasets are limited in scale, resulting in most existing methods overfitting\nto the small datasets and unable to generalize to the motions of the open\ndomain. Some methods attempt to solve the open-vocabulary motion generation\nproblem by aligning to the CLIP space or using the Pretrain-then-Finetuning\nparadigm. However, the current annotated dataset's limited scale only allows\nthem to achieve mapping from sub-text-space to sub-motion-space, instead of\nmapping between full-text-space and full-motion-space (full mapping), which is\nthe key to attaining open-vocabulary motion generation. To this end, this paper\nproposes to leverage the atomic motion (simple body part motions over a short\ntime period) as an intermediate representation, and leverage two orderly\ncoupled steps, i.e., Textual Decomposition and Sub-motion-space Scattering, to\naddress the full mapping problem. For Textual Decomposition, we design a\nfine-grained description conversion algorithm, and combine it with the\ngeneralization ability of a large language model to convert any given motion\ntext into atomic texts. Sub-motion-space Scattering learns the compositional\nprocess from atomic motions to the target motions, to make the learned\nsub-motion-space scattered to form the full-motion-space. For a given motion of\nthe open domain, it transforms the extrapolation into interpolation and thereby\nsignificantly improves generalization. Our network, $DSO$-Net, combines textual\n$d$ecomposition and sub-motion-space $s$cattering to solve the\n$o$pen-vocabulary motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nDSO-Net achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on\nopen-vocabulary motion generation.

Ripples that are unstable\nover time are challenging to remove. A typical detection limit for planetary\nspectral lines is a fraction of order 0.001 of continuum signal, restricting\nsearches for minor atmospheric trace-gases. Modern wideband spectra of Venus\ndemonstrate a plethora of effects, at three example telescopes spanning nearly\na factor of 50 in frequency. Characterisation of instrumental effects as\nfamilies of pure sine-waves via Fourier-analysis is shown to improve dynamic\nrange by factors of a few. An example upper limit on sulphuric acid vapour in\nthe Venusian mesosphere, from fully-automated data-cleaning of a 3.5 GHz band\ncontaining 10 line components, goes as deep as the best previously-published\nlimit. The most challenging cases are searches for single lines of width\ncomparable to ripple periods. Traditional polynomial-fitting approaches can be\ndeployed to test for false positives, to demonstrate robustness at a level of\nzero 'fake lines' in more than 1000 comparisons. Fourier-based data-cleaning\navoids subjectivity and can be fully automated, and synthetic spectra can be\ninjected before processing to test to what degree signals are lost in cleaning.\nAn ideal robustness strategy is mitigation at the data-acquisition stage, e.g.\nusing slow drifts in target-velocity with respect to the telescope to isolate a\nplanetary line from a quasi-static instrumental ripple pattern."

Current works often assume the causal graph is known, which may not\nalways be available a priori. Motivated by this challenge, we focus on the\ncausal bandit problem in scenarios where the underlying causal graph is unknown\nand may include latent confounders. While intervention on the parents of the\nreward node is optimal in the absence of latent confounders, this is not\nnecessarily the case in general. Instead, one must consider a set of possibly\noptimal arms/interventions, each being a special subset of the ancestors of the\nreward node, making causal discovery beyond the parents of the reward node\nessential. For regret minimization, we identify that discovering the full\ncausal structure is unnecessary; however, no existing work provides the\nnecessary and sufficient components of the causal graph. We formally\ncharacterize the set of necessary and sufficient latent confounders one needs\nto detect or learn to ensure that all possibly optimal arms are identified\ncorrectly. We also propose a randomized algorithm for learning the causal graph\nwith a limited number of samples, providing a sample complexity guarantee for\nany desired confidence level. In the causal bandit setup, we propose a\ntwo-stage approach. In the first stage, we learn the induced subgraph on\nancestors of the reward, along with a necessary and sufficient subset of latent\nconfounders, to construct the set of possibly optimal arms. The regret incurred\nduring this phase scales polynomially with respect to the number of nodes in\nthe causal graph. The second phase involves the application of a standard\nbandit algorithm, such as the UCB algorithm. We also establish a regret bound\nfor our two-phase approach, which is sublinear in the number of rounds."

While point-wise\nassessment has many potential applications, incorporating automated large area\nscanning would enable holistic tissue sampling. However, such scanning tasks\nare challenging due to their long-horizon dependency and the requirement for\nfine-grained motion. To address these issues, we introduce Memorized Action\nChunking with Transformers (MACT), an intuitive yet efficient imitation\nlearning method for tissue surface scanning tasks.

To address the scalability\nchallenges, we investigated AQFP shift registers with the AQFP footprint area\nreduced by 25% with respect to prior work and with more than 2x denser overall\ndesigns obtained by eliminating the previously used free space between the\nAQFPs. We also investigated AQFP cells with different designs of flux trapping\nmoats in the superconducting ground plane as well as compact AQFP cells that\ntook advantage of the smaller feature sizes available in the new fabrication\nprocess, SFQ5ee+, at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This new process features nine\nplanarized Nb layers with a 0.25 $\\mu$m minimum linewidth.\n  The fabricated circuits were tested in a liquid He probe and in a\nclosed-cycle cryocooler using a controlled cooling rate through the\nsuperconducting critical temperature. Using multiple thermal cycles, we\ninvestigated flux trapping in the dense AQFP shift registers as well as in the\nregisters using the old (sparse) AQFP designs at two levels of the residual\nmagnetic field, about 0.53 $\\mu$T and about 1.2 $\\mu$T. The sparse designs\ndemonstrated 95% to almost 100% probability of operation after the cooldown and\nvery wide operation margins, although the flux trapping probability was\nincreasing with circuit complexities. The margins were similarly wide in the\nnewer dense designs, but flux trapping probability that rendered the registers\nnonoperational was significantly, by an order of magnitude, higher in the\ndenser circuits and was also very sensitive to the moats' shape and location.\n  Our findings indicate that AQFP circuits are amendable to increasing the\nscale of integration and further densification, but a careful moat design and\noptimization are required to reduce flux trapping effects in the dense AQFP\ncircuits."

In addition, most\nexisting low power neural processing engines (e.g., NPUs, DSPs, MCUs, etc.) are\ndesigned as fixed-point inference accelerators, without training capabilities.\nForward gradients, solely based on directional derivatives computed from two\nforward calls, have been recently used for model training, with substantial\nsavings in computation and memory. However, the performance of quantized\ntraining with fixed-point forward gradients remains unclear. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of on-device training using fixed-point forward\ngradients, by conducting comprehensive experiments across a variety of deep\nlearning benchmark tasks in both vision and audio domains. We propose a series\nof algorithm enhancements that further reduce the memory footprint, and the\naccuracy gap compared to backpropagation.

In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a\nnovel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol, dubbed Muckle+, that is particularly useful\nin large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. Their\nprotocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional\nand post-quantum primitives, as well as from quantum key distribution, to be\nincorporated into a single end-to-end shared key.\n  To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes\npost-quantum digital signatures. However, available instantiations of such\nsignatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum\nkey-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks\nwith potentially several connections in a short period of time.\n  To mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency\nboundaries of currently known HAKE constructions. Muckle# uses post-quantum\nkey-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent\nworks done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols,\nparticularly, in KEMTLS (CCS'20).\n  We port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques\non the way.
